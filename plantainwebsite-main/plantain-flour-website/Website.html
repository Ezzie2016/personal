            <h2><a href="story.html" class="no-style"> Story</h2>
            <p>At Plantation, we believe that nature's simplicity holds the key to a healthier, more sustainable lifestyle. Our journey began with a humble plant—plantain. Grown in the fertile soils of Nigeria, plantains are a staple in many African homes. We realized that this versatile fruit, rich in nutrients and flavor, had more to offer than just being a delicious meal.

                Our founder, raised in the heart of the Nigerian countryside, grew up with plantains as a core part of family meals. Over the years, they discovered the countless ways plantains could be transformed into more than just food—into products that nourish the body, mind, and spirit.
                
                We began with plantain flour, carefully crafted from the freshest plantains, hand-selected and processed with the utmost care to preserve all the nutrients. From there, the possibilities unfolded: plantain chips, snacks, powder, and even smoothies, all harnessing the natural power of plantain. The best part? Our products are eco-friendly and sustainable, produced with minimal waste and a deep respect for the earth.
                
                Plantation isn't just a name—it's a reflection of our commitment to bringing the goodness of plantains to your life. Whether it's a healthy snack or a natural skincare solution, every item we create is infused with the love and wisdom passed down through generations. Our goal is to share the beauty of plantain with the world, one product at a time, while supporting local farmers and communities along the way.
                
                From farm to table, and beyond, we're proud to offer products that honor tradition, embrace innovation, and make the world a better place, one plantain at a time.
